# Kontrol

Struggling to kontrol your smart contracts behave as intended, even after thorough unit testing, fuzzing, and other validation procedures? Frustrated with finding bugs in your code but unable to prove their absence?

[**Kontrol**](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kontrol) is designed for you!


- **Open Source**: Kontrol is open source under the [BSD-3 Clause License](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kontrol/blob/master/LICENSE). This gives you full Kontrol to use, modify, and redistribute it according to your needs.
- **Easy to Use**: Kontrol gives you the advantage of using languages and testing frameworks youâ€™re already familiar with. Kontrol enables developers to write formal specifications as [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) tests in [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org). In addition, this allows developers to reuse their existing test suites for formal verification.
- **Scalable**: Kontrol automatically verifies your contracts against your formal specifications via compositional symbolic execution. It generates proofs during the verification process, allowing you to verify contracts of any size. Additionally, Kontrol enhances efficiency by supporting lemmas, loop invariants, and bounded model checking.
- **Trustworthy**: Kontrol has a trustworthy mathematical foundation for specifying and verifying smart contracts. It is built on the open-source, validated, and intuitive formal semantics of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode, [KEVM](https://github.com/runtimeverification/evm-semantics). This provides an additional guarantee that the smart contracts you have verified will demonstrate the exact same behavior when executed by the virtual machine.

- **CI Integrated**: In addition to running locally, Kontrol can be integrated into your project's CI for continuous assurance, cloud-based verification, and visualization capabilities via [KaaS](https://docs.runtimeverification.com/kaas).
